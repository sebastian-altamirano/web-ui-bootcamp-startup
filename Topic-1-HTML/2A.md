__Add *doctype* to the previously created HTML documents. See what happens if you remove it.__

I only noticed minor differences in margin and padding in some of the documents, yet all worked flawlessly without the doctype tag. I only tested in Firefox and Chrome though, but according to [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#the-doctype), when omitted, browsers may render the content following rules that are not in the specification.

__Add the meta viewport tag. Check what happens in a mobile browser with or without it.__

Without the viewport tag, the exercises are too small to see, but with it, the content is resized to fit the device width. Yet the video tag remains unresponsive in both, PC and mobile browsers, but it could be fixed using a parent div to force a width.

__Validate your markup: W3C Validator.__

Since i used Emmet to create the documents, W3C Validator only detected flaws in the body markup, and those flaws were:

- A polyfill should be used for the "date" input type.
- Form action attribute value shouldn't be left blank.
- The select element must have an option element with an empty value as first child.
- Br tags should be used like this `<br>`.
